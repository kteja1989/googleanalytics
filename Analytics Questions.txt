Reflection

Consider what you reviewed about the phases of data analysis and the stages of the data life cycle:

What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?

What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?

Reflect on your learning and think about how you can apply the phases of data to future projects.

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.

1 / 1 point
1. The data life cycle is managing the data throughout the lifespan whereas the Data analysis process is a process in the lifecycle that stresses extracting the behavioral changes of the data. The similarities is that both processes involve the examination of data on where it has to be stored and on what conclusion basis.

2. Plan: Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
Ask: We ask the relevant questions about what the stakeholders want, when these are required, why they are required, and how best to communicate with them. Here the similarities is asking the questions and the main difference is asking the relevant questions in those stages.
Correct
Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would consider the phases that data goes through in its life cycle and how this impacts the data analysis process.

While the data analysis process will drive your projects and help you reach your business goals, you must understand the life cycle of your data in order to use that process. To analyze your data well, you need to have a thorough understanding of it. Similarly, you can collect all the data you want, but the data is only useful to you if you have a plan for analyzing it.

The Plan and Ask phases both involve planning and asking questions, but they tackle different subjects. The Ask phase in the data analysis process focuses on big-picture strategic thinking about business goals. However, the Plan phase focuses on the fundamentals of the project, such as what data you have access to, what data you need, and where you’re going to get it.

Question 1
Case Study #1 

To improve the effectiveness of its teaching staff, the administration of a high school offered the opportunity for all teachers to participate in a workshop. They were not required to attend; instead, the administration encouraged teachers to sign up. Of the 43 teachers on staff, 19 chose to take the workshop.

At the end of the academic year, the administration collected data on teacher performance for all teachers on staff. The data was collected via student survey. In the survey, students were asked to rank each teacher's effectiveness on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 6 (very good). 

The administration compared data on teachers who attended the workshop to data on teachers who did not. The comparison revealed that teachers who attended the workshop had an average score of 4.95, while teachers who did not attend had an average score of 4.22. The administration concluded that the workshop was a success.

Reflection

Consider this scenario: 

What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below. 

1 / 1 point
1. What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?
The above scenario is an example of Misrepresentation, which is providing false information about a product, service, or situation. Might be the teachers did not know the importance of the workshop which is the reason the participation is less.
2. Educate them about the advantages of workshop that is being conducted in the school and the benefits they would gain is the one that can help the data analyst to correct the unfair practices.
Correct
Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! In your response, you likely noted that this is an example of unfair practice. It is tempting to conclude—as the administration did—that the workshop was a success. However, since the workshop was voluntary and not random, it is not appropriate to infer a causal relationship between attending the workshop and the higher rating.

The workshop might have been effective, but other explanations for the differences in the ratings cannot be ruled out. For example, another explanation could be that the staff volunteering for the workshop were the better, more motivated teachers. This group of teachers would be rated higher whether or not the workshop was effective.

It’s also notable that there is no direct connection between student survey responses and workshop attendance. The data analyst could correct this by asking for the teachers to be selected randomly to participate in the workshop. They could also collect data that measures something more directly related to workshop attendance, such as the success of a technique the teachers learned in that workshop.

2.
Question 2
Case Study #2

An automotive company tests the driving capabilities of its self-driving car prototype. They carry out the tests on various types of roadways—specifically, a race track, trail track, and dirt road.

The researchers only test the prototype during the daytime. They collect two types of data: sensor data from the car during the drives and video data of the drives from cameras on the car.

They review the data after the initial tests. The results illustrate that the new self-driving car meets the performance standards across each of the roadways. As a result, the car can progress to the next phase of testing, which will include driving in various weather conditions. 

Reflection

Consider this scenario:

What are the examples of fair or unfair practices?

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.

1 / 1 point
This can be the case of considering all the available and proceeding further. Here there can be other factors that are not visible to us and those cannot be ignored. To correct them, consider the additional data that can help them to gain additional insights.
Correct
Once again, this case study shows an unfair practice. Your response probably mentioned that, although the researchers test the prototype on three different tracks, they only conduct tests during the day.

Conditions on each track may be very different during the day and night and this could change the results significantly. The data analyst should correct this by asking the test team to add in nighttime testing to get a full perspective of how the prototype performs at any time of the day on the tracks.

3.
Question 3
Case Study #3

An amusement park plans to add new rides to their property. First, they need to determine what kinds of new rides visitors want the park to build. In order to understand their visitors’ interests, the park develops a survey. 

They decide to distribute the survey near the roller coasters because the lines are long enough that visitors will have time to answer all of the questions. After collecting this survey data, they find that most of the respondents want more roller coasters at the park. They conclude that they should add more roller coasters, as most of their visitors prefer them.

Reflection

Consider this scenario:

What are the examples of fair or unfair practices? 

How could a data analyst correct the unfair practices?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.

1 / 1 point
Using self-reporting methods to collect data can help avoid these observer biases. Additionally, separating self-reported data from other data you collect provides important context and is fair practice. For correction of unfair practices, the analysts can avoid bias that might be introduced with other demographic data collection methods. If they had the survey report that tells the observations about customers' interests, they might introduce any unconscious bias the employees had to the data and this should be avoided.
Correct
A thoughtful reflection would have included information about the decision to distribute surveys in places where visitors would have time to respond. Otherwise, it accidentally introduces sampling bias.

The only respondents to the survey are people waiting in line for the roller coasters. This may unfairly bias survey results, because respondents might prefer roller coasters. A data analyst could reduce sampling bias by distributing the survey at the entrance and exit of the amusement park. This would avoid targeting roller coaster fans and provide results from the park’s general audience.

Overview

Now that you have been introduced to the SMART framework for asking questions, pause to apply what you are learning. In this self-reflection, you will consider the questions you would ask in a specific scenario. 

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply your knowledge of the SMART question framework to your own data investigations. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

The scenario

You are three weeks into your new job as a junior data analyst. The company you work for has just collected data on their weekend sales. Your manager asks you to perform a thorough exploration of this data. To get this project started, you must ask some questions and get some information.

SMART questions

As a refresher, SMART questions are:

Specific: Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.

Measurable: Questions can be quantified and assessed.

Action-oriented: Questions encourage change.

Relevant: Questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you’re trying to solve. 

Time-bound: Questions specify the time to be studied.

Next, you will use the SMART framework to ask effective questions about the scenario above. Then, you will reflect on the topics your SMART questions should address.

Ask the right type of questions

You can apply the SMART framework to all types of questions. The type of questions you ask can help you explore deeper with your data. Consider the ways your questions help you examine objectives, audience, time, security, and resources.

Some common topics for questions include: 

Objectives

Audience

Time

Resources

Security

Think about how you can ask SMART questions about each of these topics.

Reflection

Consider the scenario above:

Based on the SMART framework, which questions are most important to ask? 

How will these questions clarify the requirements and goals for the project?

How does asking detailed, specific questions benefit you when planning for a project? Can vague or unclear questions harm a project?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.

1 / 1 point
1. What is the sales change in the current week based on the earlier weeks of this quarterly period?
2. Could there be any improvement if the trend is decreasing based on the earlier data?
3. Are there any issues that need to be addressed on a priority basis?
4. If the sales are increasing based on the earlier week, could you tell me what could be numbers for the coming weeks?

If these questions can be answered the goals can be achieved in the expected period. Asking any vague questions can lead to out-of-context conclusions and unwanted results.
Correct
Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection on this topic would describe how you applied SMART questions to the scenario.

Here are a few questions you might want to ask:

When is the project due?

Are there any specific challenges to keep in mind? 

Who are the major stakeholders for this project, and what do they expect this project to do for them?

Who am I presenting the results to?

Here are some examples of questions you might ask based on the suggested topics:

Objectives: What are the goals of the deep dive? What, if any, questions are expected to be answered by this deep dive?

Audience: Who are the stakeholders? Who is interested or concerned about the results of this deep dive? Who is the audience for the presentation?

Time: What is the time frame for completion? By what date does this need to be done?

Resources: What resources are available to accomplish the deep dive's goals?

Security: Who should have access to the information?

These questions can help you focus on techniques and analyses that produce results of interest to stakeholders. They also clarify the deliverable’s due date, which is important to know so you can manage your time effectively. When you start work on a project, you need to ask questions that align with the plan and the goals and help you explore the data. The more questions you ask, the more you learn about your data, and the more powerful your insights will be.

Asking thorough and specific questions means clarifying details until you get to concrete requirements. With clear requirements and goals, it’s much easier to plan and execute a successful data analysis project and avoid time-consuming problems down the road.




Overview

Now that you have learned more about SMART questions, you can pause for a moment and ask your own. In this self-reflection, you will consider your thoughts about the SMART question framework.

This self-reflection will help you develop insights into your own learning and prepare you to apply the SMART framework to your own data investigations. As you answer questions—and come up with questions of your own—you will consider concepts, practices, and principles to help refine your understanding and reinforce your learning. You’ve done the hard work, so make sure to get the most out of it: This reflection will help your knowledge stick!

Ask real-world questions

In this activity, you will have a data conversation with someone you know. This can be in person, over the phone, or in a video chat. 

Choose someone in your life who uses data to make better decisions. This might be a family member who runs a small business, a friend who leads a committee for the Parent Teacher Association, or a neighbor who teaches piano lessons. All of these people turn to data in some way to be more effective in their roles.

Let them know you're training to be a data analyst, and would like to have a chat about data to practice your skills asking questions. By the end of this conversation, you'll end up with some useful insights that will benefit both of you.

Plan for the conversation

First, decide who you will speak with and how they might use data. Your goal is to plan for a successful conversation. Think about how much time you need and how you will use it. For this step, review the following advice:

Prioritize your questions: Prepare to ask the most important and interesting questions first.

Make your time count: Stay on subject during the conversation.

Clarify your understanding: To avoid confusion, build in some time to summarize answers to make sure you understood them correctly. This will go a long way in helping you avoid mistakes. For example, in a conversation with a teacher, you might check your understanding with a statement like, “Just to double check that I understand what you’re saying correctly, you currently use test scores in the following ways…”

Depending on the field they are in, the person you chat with may not be comfortable sharing detailed data with you. That's okay! Be sure to respect what they are willing to share during your conversation.

Create questions

Now, come up with questions to help you understand their business goals, the type of data they interact with, and any limitations of the data.

Use the SMART question framework to make sure each question you ask makes sense based on their field. Each question should meet as many of the SMART criteria as possible. 

As a reminder, SMART questions are

Specific: Questions are simple, significant, and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.

Measurable: Questions can be quantified and assessed.

Action-oriented: Questions encourage change.

Relevant: Questions matter, are important, and have significance to the problem you’re trying to solve. 

Time-bound: Questions specify the time to be studied.

For instance, if you have a conversation with someone who works in retail, you might lead with questions like: 

Specific: Do you currently use data to drive decisions in your business? If so, what kind(s) of data do you collect, and how do you use it?

Measurable: Do you know what percentage of sales is from your top-selling products?

Action-oriented: Are there business decisions or changes that you would make if you had the right information? For example, if you had information about how umbrella sales change with the weather, how would you use it?

Relevant: How often do you review data from your business?

Time-bound: Can you describe how data helped you make good decisions for your store(s) this past year?

If you are having a conversation with a teacher, you might ask different questions, such as: 

Specific: What kind of data do you use to build your lessons?

Measurable: How well do student benchmark test scores correlate with their grades?

Action-oriented: Do you share your data with other teachers to improve lessons?

Relevant: Have you shared grading data with an entire class? If so, do students seem to be more or less motivated, or about the same?

Time-bound: In the last five years, how many times did you review data from previous academic years?

If you are having a conversation with a small business owner of an ice cream shop, you could ask:

Specific: What data do you use to help with purchasing and inventory?

Measurable: Can you order (rank) these factors from most to least influential on sales: price, flavor, and time of year (season)?

Action-oriented: Is there a single factor you need more data on so you can potentially increase sales?

Relevant: How do you advertise to or communicate with customers?

Time-bound: What does your year-over-year sales growth look like for the last three years?

Take good notes

It is important to take good notes during your conversation. Your notes should be comprehensive and useful. To help you capture meaningful notes, you should stick to a process of asking a question, clarifying your understanding of their response, and then briefly recording it in your notes. 

Remember: If a question is worth asking, then the answer is worth recording. Commit yourself to taking great notes during your conversation. 

Helpful aspects of your conversation to note include:

Facts: Write down any concrete piece of information, such as dates, times, names, and other specifics.

Context: Facts without context are useless. Note any relevant details that are needed in order to understand the information you gather.

Unknowns: Sometimes you may miss an important question during a conversation. Make a note when this happens so you can figure out the answer later. 

For example, if the previous SMART questions led the ice cream shop owner to propose a project to analyze customer flavor preferences, your notes might appear something like this:

Project: Collect customer flavor preference data.

Overall business goal: Use data to offer or create more popular flavors.

Two data sources: Cash register receipts and completed customer surveys (email).

Target completion date: Q2 

To do: Call back later and speak with the manager about the location of survey data.

The notes you will take will differ greatly based on the data conversation you have. The important thing is that your notes are clear, organized, and concise.

Now you are ready to have a great conversation about data in real life.

Reflection

Before you begin your conversation about data, consider each of the above steps. Think about potential candidates, brainstorm some SMART questions, and get an idea of the information you want to record during your conversation. Then, reflect on your conversation:

What SMART questions did you ask? How did these questions tie into the field of the person you chatted with? 

What insights did you discover during your conversation? 

How did the SMART framework help you arrive at your conclusions?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.

1 / 1 point
1. Who are the stakeholders and to whom I should present the data analysis along with their exact requirements ?
2. What are the outcomes in the current project and what changes did you make to achieve higher goals in the project?
3. Did the end analysis work out if applied with the team members?

There are always many ways where that do not appear in front of our eyes and we have to see it by applying the different by many permutations and combinations.

The SMART framework will always work by framing appropriate questions on the data we receive and performing analysis.
Correct
Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A good reflection would describe how you created relevant SMART questions and what insights they helped you gain.

Coming up with SMART questions for data-driven conversations is one of the most important tools in a data analyst’s arsenal. As you practice, you will feel more comfortable interacting with others about data and asking meaningful questions during those interactions. Going forward, you can also practice asking yourself SMART questions to help you manage and measure your own goals.

How are the different types of dashboards similar to each other?

In what ways do they differ?

Write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below.

1 / 1 point
All dashboards aim to provide a clear visual representation of data to aid decision-making. Even if displayed differently, dashboards often use the same types of metrics. Dashboards often share features like charts and graphs to communicate data visually.
Dashboards can be used for different purposes, such as operational, analytical, strategic, or tactical. For example, operational dashboards show what's happening right now, while analytical dashboards process data to identify trends. Dashboards use visual representations like graphs and gauges that can be adjusted on the fly.
Correct
Great work reinforcing your learning with a thoughtful self-reflection! A few commonalities in these examples include: 

Dashboards are visualizations: Visualizing data can be enormously useful for understanding and demonstrating what the data really means.  

Dashboards identify metrics: Relevant metrics may help analysts assess company performance.

Some differences include the timeframe described in each dashboard.  The operational dashboard has a timeframe of days and weeks, while the strategic dashboard displays the entire year. The analytic dashboard skips a specific timeframe. Instead, it identifies and tracks the various KPIs that may be used to assess strategic and operational goals.

2.
Question 2
Now that you have considered the different types of dashboards, think about the impact that dashboards can have on a company:

What is an example of a data source a company might use with a dashboard?

How would a company benefit from a dashboard that uses this data?

What industries or businesses might benefit from using dashboards more than others?

Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions. Enter your response in the text box below. 

1 / 1 point
An example of a data source a company might use with a dashboard is customer relationship management (CRM) software. This software collects and stores data related to customer interactions, such as purchase history, support tickets, and website activity. Dashboards can help users monitor operations, optimize processes, and improve overall business performance by having data readily available. Retail: Retail businesses use dashboards to track sales performance, inventory levels, and customer behavior.
Correct
Thank you for your response! Dashboards can help companies perform many helpful tasks, such as:

Track historical and current performance.

Establish both long-term and/or short-term goals.

Define key performance indicators or metrics.

Identify potential issues or points of inefficiency.

While almost every company can benefit in some way from using a dashboard, larger companies and companies with a wider range of products or services will likely benefit more. Companies operating in volatile, or swiftly changing markets like marketing, sales, and tech also tend to more quickly gain insights and make data-informed decisions.
